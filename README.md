## DISCLAIMER: If you are a student and want to copy homework from here, make sure what you copy is correct, as there can be solutions which were not graded with the maximum points. I did not construct this as a repo from where you can just take the homework and present it, it is rather what I did during my years here, whether correct or not. Most of the solutions are, but be aware that some might not be perfect.
